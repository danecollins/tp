<p>
Today I'm releasing the first beta release of Track Places.  For those of you that saw the preview you'll notice these changes:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>You can now create your own account.</li>
 	<li>There is now a Guest User Mode so people can browse without creating an account.</li>
 	<li>A <b>Cuisine</b> field has been added to places.</li>
 	<li>You can now search for places by name and add them to your list if they are not already there.</li>
 	<li>There is now an About page that gives some background info.</li>
 </ol>

 <p>I hope you like the changes. I'm sure you'll run into issues and as you do please add them as comments to this post or email them to dane@dacxl.com</p>

 <p>Thanks for trying out Track Places</p>

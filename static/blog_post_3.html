You'll see the following changes:
</p>

<h4>New place detail view</h4>
    <p>The place detail view is now a table intead of a list and it includes images for the <b>outdoor</b>, <b>dog friendly</b> and <b>rating</b> fields.  You'll still set these as text when you edit them.</p>

<h4>Rating field range</h4>
    <p>Because of the new images for ratings it's now important that you use <b>-1</b> for a place you don't want to go back to, <b>0</b> for a place you have not rated and <b>1, 2 or 3</b> to rate a place you have been to.  These are the only values that will display as images.</p>

<h4>Cities in Search are now links to details</h4>
    <p>In v0.01 you could search for places on the search page but your only option then was to add them.  Now the cities are links to the details page so you can look at them before deciding whether to add them.</p>

<h4>iPhone Add to Home Screen now adds an icon</h4>
    <p>If you use the <b>Add to Home Screen</b> function on the iPhone you'll now get a TP icon image</p>
    
 <p>I hope you like the changes. I'm sure you'll run into issues and as you do please add them as comments to this post or email them to dane@dacxl.com</p>

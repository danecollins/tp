<p>
You'll see the following changes:
</p>

<dt><b>New field for visit type</b></dt>
    <dd>There is now a separate field to track whether you have been to a place or if it's a place you want to go to.  Because of this ratings of -1 should no longer be used.</dd>

<dt><b>Button to add places</b></dt>
	<dd>In Beta 0.02 you could so a search and add a place from the search page.  This was inconvenient because you did not know the city and locale of the place when adding.  Because of this I have moved the add capability to a button on the details page. Now, to add a place, just click on the link to the details page and press the Add button</dd>

<h4>A few other minor changes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>There is a new botton to open the yelp page for a place in a separate tab</li>
    <li>When you are on the search page, you can now hover over the place name to see the city and locale</li>
    <li>The search page now eliminates duplicates</li>
    <li>The blog page now shows the number of comments and the last comment date</li>
    <li>Fixed a problem with adding new places</li>
</ul>


 <p>I hope you like the changes and thanks for trying out Track Places</p>

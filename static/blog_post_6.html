<p>
For version 0.05 there are several minor usability changes. I hope you like them.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>In the locale view there is now a filter that lets you filter restaurants based on some of the fields.  Just select the field and click on Filter.</li>
	<li>The rating and cuisine fields are now drop-down fields to make data entry easier.  If you find any missing cuisines let me know.</li>
	<li>There is a new icon that is less negative for ourdoor/no-outdoor seating</li>
	<li>The home page now lists the last place added by a user.  This is the start of a panel showing the latest activity by users in case you want to add those places to your list</li>
	<li>When you search, the search will now match the cuisine and the city fields.  This means if you search for italian it will find restaurants with italian in their name or italian in their cuisine fields.</li>
</ul>


 <p>I hope you like the changes and thanks for trying out Track Places</p>
